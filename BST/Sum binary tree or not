Sum binary tree or not

Given a binary tree. Check whether the given tree is a Sum-binary Tree or not.

Sum-binary Tree is a Binary Tree where the value of a every node is equal to sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree.

An empty tree is Sum-binary Tree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.

Return 1 if it sum-binary tree else return 0.
